This directory contains scripts, modules, whatever, that are related to
mod_perl but not part of the distribution or part of any maintained
distribution.  These files are here to give you more ideas and direction,
as to what you can do with mod_perl.  These files need not be polished, 
finished or even working for that matter, but that's not to say they are not.
If you have any to add, please let <a href="mailto:dougm@osf.org">me</a>
know.
