Description:
AuthCookie allows you to intercept a users first unauthenticated access
to a protected document. The user will be presented with a custom form
where they can enter thier authentication credentials. The credentials
are posted to the server where AuthCookie verifies them and generates a
session key.

The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a
cookie, the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent
accesses. AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate
the user.

All you have to do is write a custom package that inheriets from
AuthCookie.  Your package implements a function to 1) verify the
credentials and return the session key and 2) verify the session key.
Hint: as in the example you can just return the credentials in step 1,
and verify them on each access (a.k.a AuthBasic).

Using AuthCookie versus AuthBasic you get two key benefits (which by
the way, is why I wrote AuthCookie). One, the client doesn't *have* to
pass the user credentials on every subsequent access, you of course
have to do a little more work to get this feature. Two, when you
determine that the client should stop using the credentials/session
key, the server can tell the client to delete the cookie. This was just
something I could conviently do with AuthBasic.

Requirements:
This uses mod_perl's stacked handlers and method handlers. So, you need
to compile/recompile it with PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS=1 and
PERL_METHOD_HANDLERS=1. Some of the method functions used during
authorization require perl 5.004.

Installation:
1) Put AuthCookie.pm in $PERL5LIB/site_lib/Apache. This package needs to
   changes or custimizations.
2) Pick a name for your new authentication scheme. For the examples I'll
   use WhatEverYouWant. In the examples substitute your choice. (If I
   ever finish this distribution, It'll do this automatically)
3) In $PERL5LIB/site_lib create a directory WhatEverYouWant, put
   AuthCookieHandler.pm here.
4) Add sample.access.conf to your access.conf OR add the contents of 
   sample.startup.pl to your PerlScript.
5) Copy login.pl to you document root directory.
6) Copy sample.htaccess to .htaccess in the directory to protect.
